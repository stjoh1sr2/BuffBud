## How to Install
Downloading the BuffBud app is straightforward. The best way is to download the BuffBud.jar file and BuffBudFX.zip, which includes the entire Java project folder from the Eclipse IDE. From there, no installation is necessary. Because BuffBud.jar was not created by a trusted company, web browsers may attempt to block the download. However, as there is no malicious software attached to this app, it is acceptable (and necessary to complete installation) to bypass these warnings.

## How to Run
### Using BuffBud.jar
To run the program using BuffBud.jar, you can simply double click on the .jar file or right click and press "open". If the .jar file will not run, there is likely a permissions error, as BuffBud requires the creation of folders in the user's home directory and the creation of a text file. If this is the case, then running the program as an administrator may resolve the issue.

### Running from Eclipse IDE
A less convienient way to run the BuffBud application is through the Eclipse IDE. First, you must import the program into the IDE, and secondly, you must resolve any issues and run the main method (application.Launcher).
